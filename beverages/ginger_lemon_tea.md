# Ginger-Lemon Tea

Amazing for a respiratory illness, this tea is potent and spicy.

## Ingredients

- Two-inch root of ginger
- Honey
- Half a lemon
- 2 cups of water


## Instructions

Peel the ginger and cut it into slices length-wise to increase surface area. Cook the ginger in water for about 30 minutes, bringing it to a boil at first and then letting it simmer. Remove from heat and add honey to taste. Squeeze lemon into the mixture and serve.

Longer simmering time and more lemon increases the strength of this tea.
