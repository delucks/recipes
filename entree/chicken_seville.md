# Chicken Seville

Family recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1/4 c butter
- 8oz or more button mushrooms
- 1/4 c finely diced onion
- 1/2 c flour
- 1/4 tsp ground pepper
- 1/4 tsp dry mustard
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg
- 2 cans gravy or 2-3 c homemade gravy
- 1/4 c sherry
- 2 c chopped cooked chicken

## Instructions

Saute√© mushrooms and onions in butter until tender but not browned.

Combine flour and spices. Blend into flour mixture slowly so it doesn't get all lumpy.

Slowly stir in gravy (again: lumps). Add everything else and heat on low.

Prepare biscuits for base: use any recipe but add 1 tsp poultry seasoning for every cup of flour. Mix the poultry seasoning with all the dry ingredients.
