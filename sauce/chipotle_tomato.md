# Chipotle Tomato Sauce

AKA "The Cowboy"

## Ingredients

- 2 Poblano peppers
- 8 Masilla (Long Hot) pepper
- 28oz canned whole tomato
- 1/2 large white onion
- 6 cloves Garlic
- 1.5 tbsp Chipotle pepper powder
- 1 tbsp Crushed red pepper
- 2 tsp salt
- Pinch smoked paprika powder
- Pinch cayenne pepper powder
- White vinegar
- EVOO

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash all peppers and coat them with olive oil then place them on a baking sheet. Bake in the 400 degree oven for 15 minutes on each side, or until the skin is browned and wrinkly.

Chop the onion and dice the garlic.

Sautee the onion in a large saucepan with some olive oil. Add the garlic about 5 minutes into the sautee, or whenever the onions appear transparent. Sautee for another couple minutes, then deglaze with some of the vinegar. Pour all of the tomato into the pan and add the roasted peppers, stirring until combined. Add the chipotle pepper powder, salt, and crushed red pepper flakes. Put in a dash each of paprika and cayenne.

Simmer this mixture for 15 minutes, then add more vinegar and dry seasonings to taste. Immersion blend the mixture or transfer it into a food processor.

Refridgerate the resulting sauce; this recipe will keep in the fridge for several weeks.
