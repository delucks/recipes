# Pineapple Ginger Hot Sauce

AKA "The Jerk"

## Ingredients

- 4 cups pineapple
- 6 Habanero peppers
- 4 Cubanelle peppers
- 1 light cup raisins
- One large white Onion
- 1 light cup ginger root
- Grapeseed oil
- Brown sugar
- 2 cups white vinegar

## Instructions

Chop the onion and pineapple. Remove the stems from the peppers. Make sure to keep the seeds & inner material intact; they will give this sauce spiciness.
Peel the ginger root with a spoon and cut it finely. Chop the peppers roughly; I did about 4 inch chunks.

Sautee the onion in a large saucepan with some grapeseed oil, adding the ginger when the onion is transparent. After the ginger becomes fragrant, add the peppers, pineapple, raisins, and vinegar. Simmer this mixture for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the brown sugar and transfer the mixture to a blender. Puree until smooth and transfer back to the saucepot. Season with salt, vinegar, and sugar until the taste is right.

Refridgerate the resulting sauce; this recipe will keep in the fridge for several weeks.
