## Instructions

Grind allspice and other whole ingredients into a fine powder. Mix together inside a container and shake to combine well.

Peel the pineapple and core it. Cut it into smaller chunks and place it in a food processor, processing until completely pureed.

Chop the onion finely and remove the tops from the peppers. Peel the ginger root using a spoon and chop it into inch-long strips. Put a splash of oil into a saucepan, heating it to medium. Add the onion and ginger, cook until the onion is transparent, stirring the whole time. Add the peppers and jerk mix, mixing thoroughly. When this becomes really fragrant, add the vinegar and bring to a boil.

Boil this mixture for an hour to create the spicy vinegar. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pineapple puree and the spicy vinegar and mix well, immersion blending if necessary to remove chunks.

Test pH of resulting sauce. If it's greater than 4, refridgerate the sauce. If it's less than four, the sauce will keep at room temperature for a few weeks.
