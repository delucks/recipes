# Pineapple Ginger Hot Sauce

AKA "The Jerk". This sauce is on the second revision. 

## Ingredients

- 1 medium-sized pineapple
- 3 Habanero peppers
- 2 Jalapeno peppers
- Half a small yellow onion
- 1 light cup ginger root (around 50g)
- Grapeseed oil
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- Pinch star anise seeds
- 1/4 tsp ginger powder
- 3 peppercorn kernels
- 1/2 tsp arrowroot starch

## Instructions

Reserve 1/3 of the pineapple. Take this third, trim around the core and put it into a food processor. Process until pureed and whipped.

Chop the onion and remainder of the pineapple. Remove the stems from the peppers. Make sure to keep the seeds & inner material intact; they will give this sauce spiciness.
Peel the ginger root with a spoon and cut it finely. Chop the peppers roughly; I did about 4 inch chunks.

Sautee the onion in a large saucepan with some grapeseed oil, adding the ginger when the onion is transparent. After the ginger becomes fragrant, add the peppers and dry seasonings. Stir continuously until you can smell the seasonings mixing in with the onion & ginger. Add the pineapple and vinegar. Bring this mixture to a boil then simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain this mixture and return to the pot. On low heat, add arrowroot starch and pineapple puree, stir until combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings until it's perfect.

Refridgerate the resulting sauce; this recipe will keep in the fridge for several weeks.
