# Mango Habanero Tomato sauce

Attempting smaller batch this time around, in a 2qt pot rather than a 3qt

## Ingredients

- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1 tbsp EVOO
- 2 habanero peppers, drawn and quartered
- 2c diced tomato
- 2 tbsp white vinegar
- 1 light tbsp chipotle pepper powder
- 1/4tsp cumin
- 1/2tsp salt
- 1 small mango, peeled & chopped
- 1 1/2 cups of water
- Half a fresh lime (for juice to taste)

## Instructions

Sautee the onion until transparent in the EVOO, then add garlic. Sautee until very fragrant, then add the habanero peppers and vinegar. Cook for a few minutes, then add the tomato. While bringing this mixture to a boil, add the chipotle pepper, salt, and cumin. Add 1 cup of the water. Let this simmer after boiling for about an hour. Add the chopped mango and the remaining water, cook for another hour or so. Strain the mixture into a bowl, reserving the liquid. Combine the liquid with all chunks of mango from the strainer (pick them out), puree until smooth. Add lime juice until the heat of the habanero is balanced out with the citrus.
