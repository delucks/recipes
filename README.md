# recipes

Welcome to my website! spicyboysauce.party contains a bunch of recipes that I have developed and refined over time. It's called spicyboysauce because I really like making hot sauce and I'm a pretty spicy boy.

This website is [on github](https://github.com/delucks/recipes) and all the recipes are formatted in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) so they are easy to modify and contribute to. If you come up with a better version of one of my recipes, **please** open a request to change it. I put these on the internet with the hope that you can try and refine them with your own unique palate.

I hope you enjoy my food!
